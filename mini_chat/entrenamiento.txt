Artificial intelligence is transforming industries by automating tasks and improving decision-making.
Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming.
The Turing Test, proposed by Alan Turing, is a way to evaluate a machine's ability to exhibit human-like intelligence.
Climate change refers to long-term changes in temperature and weather patterns, primarily due to human activities.
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming and climate change.
Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power help reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy, producing oxygen as a byproduct.
The human brain consists of billions of neurons that communicate through electrical and chemical signals.
DNA carries genetic information and determines many characteristics of living organisms.
Quantum computing leverages principles of quantum mechanics to perform complex calculations much faster than classical computers.
The Internet was invented in the late 20th century and revolutionized communication and information sharing.
A black hole is a region of space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.
The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second.
Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius and freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric conditions.
